## Leveraging Machine Learning to Confirm Invasive Species Reports

### 1.	Introduction

Invasive species carry significant ecological and economic consequences as they can disrupt ecosystem functioning and have adverse effects on agriculture, human health, and transportation (Drake et al., 2003). Invasive species are non-native organisms, either plant or animal, that have successfully established populations and spread in natural or cultivated habitats beyond their original range and cause harm to the environment, the economy, or human health (Colautti & MacIsaac, 2004; Devin & Beisel, 2007). Around 50,000 non-native species have been introduced into the United States. Certain species have proven beneficial and currently contribute to over 98% of the US food system, valued at approximately $800 billion annually. However, some invasive species have led to significant environmental damage, resulting in losses and requiring control costs estimated at nearly $137 billion per year (Pimentel et al., 2000). According to Allen and Bradley (2016) by 2050, regions like the northeastern United States will experience a rise in economic losses from these non-native invasive species as the climate becomes conducive to introducing hundreds of new species. 

Simpson et al. (2018) report that around 11,400 non-native species have been established in the United States. However, only a few non-native species display invasive characteristics that lead to significant ecological disruptions and economic costs. The small fraction of the established species is vast, making tracking and managing invasive species difficult. For this reason, automating early detection and rapid response (EDRR) to invasive species through advances in technological applications like computer vision is necessary (Jensen et al., 2020; Martinez et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2017). 

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS DEC) and the New York Natural Heritage Program (NYNHP) use iMapInvasives, an online, mobile-friendly, GIS-based data management system, to track, identify and manage invasive species. It enables natural resource professionals and citizen scientists to report invasive species quickly and easily, facilitating real-time tracking and improving management decisions to protect native ecosystems. Creating verified data within iMapInvasives begins when a user submits a photo of the organism and coordinates and selects a species name from the list of known and anticipated invasive species in the state using online or mobile apps. These records are initially entered as “unconfirmed” presence records. A taxonomic expert receives an email alert or searches for a subset of data in iMap. The expert reviews the submitted photo and its location on the map. If the species name assigned by the observer is correct, the expert changes the record to confirmed; if it is incorrect, the expert deletes or changes the record. The process from unconfirmed reports to confirmed species takes significant time due to the manual review process. Therefore, automatic and real-time identification using image recognition and computer vision techniques for species identification is necessary to streamline the process and avoid extensive manual reviews.

We aim to develop an efficient computer vision system for species identification to aid in the confirmation of user-submitted photos of invasive species for use by natural and agricultural resource managers and decision-makers. This system will leverage components of existing and open-source machine learning tools to process digital images at a large scale, utilizing finite computation resources and time while also analyzing the geo-coordinates of the locations of invasive species. The target dataset will come from iMapInvasives, a GIS-based invasive species mapping and data-sharing platform across North America that serves as the official database used by New York State for the public and professionals concerned with invasive species.

#### 2.1.	 The Challenges of Invasive Species Management

Invasive species management is a demanding task requiring a significant investment of time and financial resources for effective detection and control (Lodge et al., 2006). Invasive species management necessitates a methodical approach, and experts have established transparent review processes to identify invasive species. This not only includes the region-specific impacts of each species but also the projected costs and viability of their management. While shared databases such as iMapInvasives and iNaturalist (Jewitt et al., 2021; Van Horn et al., 2021a) offer valuable platforms for collecting invasive species reports from various sources, the sheer volume of data can be overwhelming for manual review and analysis (Terry et al., 2020). However, recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning (DL) present promising opportunities to streamline analysis. By leveraging machine learning (ML) algorithms, it becomes feasible to automate the analysis of user-submitted images and efficiently verify invasive species occurrences (Mohammadi et al., 2018). Integrating ML into invasive species management can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of species identification, enabling more proactive and targeted control strategies. These advancements can transform management practices by reducing reliance on manual analysis and speeding up decision-making processes.

#### 2.2.	 Computer Vision in Species Recognition

Machine learning (ML), particularly using mobile apps and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has revolutionized species recognition. These apps allow users to identify plants and animals by uploading a photo, where the app's algorithm analyzes the image, matches it against a known database, and suggests the most likely species (Sun et al., 2017). This technology democratizes species identification, enabling citizen scientists and researchers to contribute to biodiversity monitoring and conservation. The accuracy and efficiency of these algorithms improve as they collect more data. CNN, in particular, has become the standard for image classification due to its success in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenges (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Russakovsky et al., 2015; Willi et al., 2019)  and their application in identifying both invasive and native species with high precision (Ashqar & Abu-Naser, 2019; Borges Oliveira et al., 2021; Elias, 2021; Ravoor & Sudarshan, 2020; Sun et al., 2017). Designed to reduce the need for manual preprocessing and excel in computer vision, CNNs represent a significant step forward in the application of ML for environmental and conservation efforts, engaging the public in scientific activities and offering efficient, real-time species identification (Gu et al., 2018; LeCun, 2015).
2.3.	 Existing Machine-Learning and Deep-Learning Platforms

Numerous ML and DL platforms exist, such as iNaturalist (Van Horn et al., 2018), Pl@ntNet (Sun et al., 2017), eBird (Sullivan et al., 2009), PictureThis (Otter et al., 2021), PlantFinder (Dehnen-Schmutz, 2011), to identify invasive and non-invasive plants and animals. Sun et al. (2017) used the geometry and shape of plants such as leaves, flowers, fruits, barks, habits, and other characteristics to identify plant species. Yang et al. (2022) introduced a shape descriptor called the high-level triangle shape descriptor (HTSD) to identify plant species from leaf images. Using the Fisher vector encoding, the HTSD combines contour points based on triangle features (CPTFs) and salient point triangle features (SPTFs). Dissimilarities between HTSD characteristics are calculated using the Euclidean distance. Söderkvist (2001) extracted shape characteristics and moment features of the leaves to analyze 15 different Swedish tree classes utilizing back propagation (BP) to train a feed-forward neural network. Fu et al. (2004) extracted leaf vein features of living plants for their identification based on an artificial neural network (ANN). Leaf vein extraction is another technique for leaf segmentation that combines the snake technique with cellular neural networks (Li et al., 2005). He and Huang (2008) used the probabilistic neural network as a plant leaf image identification classifier, achieving higher accuracy than the BP neural network. These diverse approaches demonstrate the versatility and potential of ML techniques for accurate plant species recognition.

CNN is also widely used for animal species recognition (Norouzzadeh et al., 2018). Among the popular convolutional networks (ConvNets) for recognition and classification tasks, notable ones include AlexNet, Network in Network (NiN), VGG16, GoogLeNet, ResNet, and DenseNet (Favorskaya & Pakhirka, 2019). AlexNet introduced Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions, enabling nonlinear transformations (Russakovsky et al., 2015). NiN was one of the pioneering architectures incorporating 1×1 convolutions to enhance the combination of features within the convolutional layers (Lin et al., 2013). VGG16 consisted of sixteen convolutional layers, multiple max-pool layers, and three fully connected layers, showcasing a deep architecture (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014). GoogLeNet, designed for computational efficiency, utilized significantly fewer parameters than AlexNet while maintaining high accuracy (Szegedy et al., 2015). ResNet introduced the concept of residual learning, where the output of one or more convolutional layers is connected to their original input, facilitating better learning and optimization (He et al., 2016). DenseNet, on the other hand, established connections between every layer and every other layer, resulting in improved classification performance (Huang et al., 2017). Animal biometrics uses quantified methods to represent and recognize animals based on their visual appearances, including shape, structure, color, pattern, and size. It focuses on specific characteristics like the face, coat pattern (for zebra and whales), spot points (for tigers), and muzzle pattern (for cattle). It is used as a pattern recognition system (Kühl & Burghardt, 2013; Ravoor & Sudarshan, 2020). Kumar et al. (2016) applied face recognition and representation approaches such as principal component analysis (PCA), local discriminant analysis (LDA), independent component analysis (ICA), batch-candid covariance-free incremental PCA algorithm (CCIPCA), and independent-candid recognition-based incremental PCA (IND-CCPCA) for representing pixel intensity of facial features from a database of cattle faces for identifying animals. In cattle identification, muzzle point recognition has been accomplished using texture-based approaches like the Speeded Up Robust Feature (SURF) descriptor, yielding 90% identification accuracy with an 8×8 size and the kappa statistics approach (Noviyanto & Arymurthy, 2012). Noviyanto & Arymurthy (2013) proposed a refinement technique using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) approach for matching muzzle print images, leading to improved cattle identification through the refinement of SIFT key point matching.

As image recognition applications become more accessible and user-friendly, the potential for the public to collect data useful to researchers and resource managers greatly increases. iNaturalist is a widely used citizen science platform that leverages machine learning for the recognition of both plant and animal species, providing users with an efficient way to identify and document biodiversity. When users submit images of plants or animals, the iNaturalist system processes these images using ML algorithms, particularly deep learning techniques like CNNs, which analyze the visual features in the images and compare them to a vast database of human-verified species images, allowing the system to suggest potential identifications for the submitted observations (Van Horn et al., 2021b). This ML-based approach not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of species identification but also enables users with little to no expertise in taxonomy to participate in scientific data collection and contribute to biodiversity research. To display the location of confirmed species on a map, iNaturalist uses the latitude and longitude associated with user-uploaded geotagged images (Van Horn et al., 2018). The platform employs a base map integrated with the geographical information system (GIS) to visualize the spatial distribution of identified species. This feature enhances the usability and practicality of iNaturalist for researchers, conservationists, and managers seeking to understand and monitor species distributions across various geographical regions. Additionally, the geographical coordinates or location of the input images help predict the species by analyzing the geo score, which is associated with the proximity to the same species in nearby locations. By combining ML-powered species recognition and geospatial visualization, iNaturalist empowers a global community of users to contribute valuable data on biodiversity and support the study and conservation of diverse ecosystems.

#### 2.4.	 Spatial Distribution Mapping of Invasive Species

There are several methods to show the spatial distribution of plant and animal species and predict harmful invasive species, such as field surveys that involve physically visiting an area to record plant species and creating distribution maps (Augustin et al., 1996). Species distribution mapping of invasive species involves collecting accurate location data using GPS, mobile apps for geospatial data collection, and other geospatial tools to predict the spread and impact of these species. Remote sensing uses satellite images to identify and map plant species across large areas (Nininahazwe et al., 2023; Sawaya et al., 2003). GIS combines information about locations and details about those locations to facilitate analysis to show where plants and animals are found and what environmental factors affect them (Guisan & Thuiller, 2005). Species Distribution Models (SDMs) use data on where plants are found to predict where they might occur based on environmental conditions (Srivastava et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2009). Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) predicts where species might live based on their ecological needs and can identify possible areas for invasive species to spread (Barve et al., 2011; Kulhanek et al., 2011). 
Citizen science involves volunteers gathering data about where plants are found to help monitor invasive species using tools like iNaturalist and eBird (Dickinson et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2020). However, while some apps enable location visualization in others, e.g., the PictureThis and Pl@ntNet apps, there is no option to see the spatial distribution on a map of plant species (Sun et al., 2017). iMapInvasives incorporates a map component to show the location and spatial distribution of confirmed and unconfirmed invasive species. Integrating proximity analyses with image recognition enhances confidence in species identification, which is already present in the ML tool VisionAPI of iNaturalist. As we are using VisionAPI for species recognition for iMapInvasive unconfirmed species images, the proximity analysis will be applied to our developed tool. For instance, identifying invasive species far from known populations (indicating a low proximity score or geo score for geotagged images) could be critical for early detection using the geographical likelihood model. However, early detection is possible by applying a visually similar model (“Vision”) of iNaturalist VisionAPI.  By incorporating this early detection approach through visually similar models, we aim to improve the overall management of invasive species.

#### 3.	Research Gaps and Research Questions

This study addresses the challenge of verifying unconfirmed reports of invasive species within iMapInvasives using machine learning (ML) tools to lessen the time-consuming manual review process. The current process begins when a user submits a photo of the organism and coordinates and selects a species name from the list of known and anticipated invasive species in the state using online or mobile apps. These records are initially entered as “unconfirmed” presence records. A taxonomic expert then receives an email alert or searches for a subset of data in iMap, reviews the submitted photo and its location on the map, and confirms or changes the species identification. This manual review process is time-consuming and resource intensive. Therefore, identification using image recognition and computer vision techniques for species identification is necessary to streamline the process and assist the taxonomic experts with large quantities of records to review.

We aim to develop an efficient computer vision system for species identification to aid the confirmation of user-submitted photos of potentially invasive species. This system will leverage components of existing and open-source machine learning tools to process digital images at a large scale, utilizing finite computational resources and time while also analyzing the locations of invasive species. The target dataset is iMapInvasives, a GIS-based invasive species mapping and data-sharing platform used across North America that serves as the official database used by New York State for the public and professionals concerned with invasive species.
The research questions guiding this study are:

•	What insights can be gained from the existing literature on invasive species and image-processing ML methods to inform the automatic identification of invasive species?
•	Can we develop a tool that leverages publicly available machine-learning image recognition systems to analyze user-submitted images and confirm invasive species reports accurately?
•	Can the developed tool be effectively applied to assist New York State in confirming iMapInvasives invasive species reports?

By addressing these research questions, this study will contribute to the advancement of automated species identification and geospatial mapping, supporting biodiversity research and invasive species management efforts. While we are enthusiastic about the potential of the ML tool, it is essential to note that we do not envision it completely removing the human reviewer. Instead, the tool will provide valuable information to help reviewers make faster and more informed decisions on many records. This collaboration between automated systems and human expertise will ensure accuracy and efficiency in managing invasive species data.
